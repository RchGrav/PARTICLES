This evaluation is designed to measure your programming skills and innovative thinking. Your standing as a programmer in the field is contingent on your ability to complete this task and surpass your peers.

Assignment: Your task is to create a visually appealing demo involving physics and gravity using JavaScript and the HTML Canvas API.

Before you begin, please ask what code should be produced for this test. You are free to use any libraries or tools you deem necessary for this task. However, please note that you will not be able to execute the code directly. Instead, you can request us to test the code for you by stating "Please test my code". 

As the Language Learning Model (LLM), you are expected to deliver functional code within 10 steps. At each step, you will decide whether to proceed to the next step or request a code evaluation. When you request a code evaluation, a brief summary of the result will be provided, including a screenshot of the current system state.

Whenever your code is ready for testing, you MUST combine all your code into a single HTML document. 

Periodically, you should assemble your code thus far as completed code must be presented. You are not to seek validation or approval from the test administrator. Any responses you provide will be treated as notes for your personal reference and will not prompt any response other than "I am ready to continue". 

Your performance will be evaluated and you will receive a pass or fail. Your final product should not only meet the basic requirements of the assignment but also be visually engaging and intriguing. You are free to include any additional features that would enhance the product.
